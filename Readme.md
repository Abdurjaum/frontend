To be able to fully experience the start of the website,

I would personally suggest that a new account is created so as to be guided to the appropriate

pages, since an old user will automatically sign in whereas a new user will be asked question after signing up 

and guided to the welcome page.

----------------------------------------

Please note that i have used a specific terminology in the design of the pages :

Users will first access the Welcome Page which is (home.js).

Once signed up or signed in, user is sent to Home Page (welcomepage.js)

----------------------------------------

Flow of the website

Home page -> Sign up -> question 1 to 5 -> sign in -> guide page -> home page and then the rest can be decided by the user -> sign out
